Overview: This project simulates a Brain-Controlled Interface (BCI) for an exosuit using the OpenSim framework. The model is based on the Arm26 musculoskeletal model and includes physics-based control for muscle activations, inverse dynamics, and forward dynamics. Key features include: BCI Integration: Simulates brain-controlled arm movement. Muscle Activation and Control: Uses a physics-based control system. Assistive Torque Simulation: Simulates exosuit assistance for movement. Metabolic Cost Estimation: Evaluates energy expenditure with and without assistance. Inverse and Forward Dynamics: Implements real-world physics for arm movement.
